/**
 * This class is responsible for keeping track of the overall best times and
 * the best transit times. In addition it keeps track of times updated
 * in the current round and previous round. It is optimized for performance,
 * all information here is also in the state, but this class keeps things in
 * the fastest possible data structure.
 * <p/>
 * We keep track of the best over all times to be able to drop a new arrivals
 * exceeding the time already found by another branch.
 * <p/>
 * We need to keep track of the transit times, not only the overall bet times,
 * to find all the best transfers. When arriving at a stop by transit, we need
 * to find all transfers to other stops, event if there is another transfer
 * arrival with a better arrival time. The reason is that after transfer to the
 * next stop, the new arrival may become the best time at that stop. Two transfers
 * are after each other is not legal.
